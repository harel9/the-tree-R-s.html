<p style="color:white; font-size:27px"> hy! my name is harel elikamel. I grew up in petah tikva and today I live in mevo horon. I work as a  Science teacher  at 'yachad' school in modiin. this is my first website.    </p>

<p style="color:white; font-family:normal; font-size:27px">one of the most interesting and importante issues that i theach
 is ecology and how to save the environment. As humans, we consume a lot of resources
 from nature to benefit from them. Without noticing, every day we dump a very large
 amount of waste, which is mostly made of plastic, which harms animals, pollutes the environment
 , and mostly pollutes the air we breathe.On this site, I want to show you about
 these three ways to preserve the environment in which we live.

<h3 style="color:white"><u>To reduce the problem, you can use the following three simple but creative ways:</u></h3>

<ol>

<li style="color:aqua;font-size:22px"><u><b> Reduce </u></b> - Wise consumption of products can reduce the amount of our use<br> of substances that may pollute the environment.<br> For example: you should use lunch boxes instead of using plastic bags every day and throwing them in the trash.<br>  This will reduce consumption in plastic bags.<br> Also, there are many ways in which fuel and electricity consumption can be reduced to keep air cleaner.</li> <br>

<br><br>
<li style="color:aqua;font-size:22px"><u><b> Reuse</u></b> - In this way we take a product that we have finished using and use it again for another purpose.<br> For example: There are schools like the school where I teach that encourages reuse of plastic products<br> and use them again to decorate the school space.<br> Also, there are ways to reuse water. There are technological systems that know<br> how to filter some of the water we use at home, to use for irrigation</li><br>

<br><br>


<li style="color:aqua;font-size:22px"><u><b>Recycle</u></b> - Recycling is a process in which waste is dismantled and<br> returned to a state of raw material, which will be used to produce new products.<br> Nowadays there are special bins for recycling glass, plastic, paper, metals, electronic waste etc.</li><br>
